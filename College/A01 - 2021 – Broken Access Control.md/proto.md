Got it — you want a **checkpoint jump** (like quick links) so that users can **jump straight** to important sections easily, *and* make it simple for them.  
Here’s your version updated with checkpoint jumps **(table of contents at the top)** and light improvements so "even dumb people" can follow smoothly:

## ✨ Overview

This project demonstrates [**Broken Access Control**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/), where users can perform actions outside their intended permissions.

It highlights two attack types:

- [**IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- [**Forced Browsing**](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Forced_browsing)

Understanding these issues is critical to build safer applications. 🔒

## 🖥️ Lab Setup

| 🖥️ Tools               | ⚙️ Example               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Web application        | Simple PHP/MySQL App      |
| Browser                | Chrome, Firefox           |
| Burp Suite (optional)  | For request interception  |
| Localhost environment  | XAMPP / WAMP / LAMP       |

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

Follow these steps exactly:

1. **Install XAMPP / WAMP / LAMP**  
   - Download and install XAMPP (or WAMP / LAMP) depending on your OS.

2. **Start Apache and MySQL**  
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel.
   - Press **Start** on both **Apache** and **MySQL**.

3. **Place the Application Files**  
   - Copy your project folder (the one containing PHP files) into the `htdocs` folder.
   - Example path:  
     `C:\xampp\htdocs\app\`

4. **Import the Database**  
   - Go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`
   - Create a **new database** (name it `app`).
   - Use **Import** tab → upload the provided `.sql` file.

5. **Run the Web Application**  
   - Open your browser.
   - Visit:  
     `http://localhost/app/`

6. **Login Using Test Credentials**  
   - Use test users provided (example:  
     **Username:** `userA`  
     **Password:** `password123`)

## 🚨 Vulnerability Demonstration

### 🕵️‍♂️ IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

1. **Login** as **User A**.
2. Go to your profile page. Example URL:

   ```
   http://localhost/app/profile.php?id=1
   ```

3. **Modify the URL manually**:  
   Change the `id=1` to another ID, for example `id=2`:

   ```
   http://localhost/app/profile.php?id=2
   ```

4. 🎯 **Result:**  
   You are now viewing **User B's** profile without permission.

> ❗ This shows that the app does NOT verify if you own the profile you're accessing.

### 🚪 Forced Browsing

1. **Stay logged in** as a **normal user** (not admin).
2. In the browser, **manually type this URL**:

   ```
   http://localhost/app/admin.php
   ```

3. 🎯 **Result:**  
   You can access the **admin page** even though you are not an admin.

> ❗ No access control checks = very bad security!

## 🛡️ Countermeasure

To fix Broken Access Control:

- ✅ Always verify permissions **on the server**.
- ✅ Use **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.
- ✅ Apply **Principle of Least Privilege**.
- ✅ Protect direct URL access.
- ✅ Never trust client-side security only (hiding buttons ≠ security).
