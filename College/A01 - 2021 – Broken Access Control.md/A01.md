# 🛡️ Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 - A01:2021)

<br><br>

## ✨ Overview

This project demonstrates [**Broken Access Control**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/), where users can perform actions outside their intended permissions.

It highlights two main types of attacks:

- [**IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

- [**Forced Browsing**](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Forced_browsing)

Understanding these issues is important to build safer and more secure web applications. 🔒

## 🚨 Vulnerability Demonstration

### 🕵️‍♂️ IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

1. Log in as User A.

2. Observe the URL when accessing your profile:

```bash
http://localhost/app/profile.php?id=1
```

- Manually modify the id parameter:

```bash
http://localhost/app/profile.php?id=2
```

- 🎯 You are now able to view User B's profile without permission! (No proper access control check.)

### 🚪 Forced Browsing

- Try directly accessing hidden sensitive pages:

```bash
http://localhost/app/admin.php
```

- Even though you're not an admin, the page still loads! This happens because the application does not verify user roles correctly.

## 🛡️ Countermeasure

To fix Broken Access Control issues:

- ✅ Always verify permissions server-side for every sensitive action.
- ✅ Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user roles properly.
- ✅ Apply the Principle of Least Privilege — users should only have access they absolutely need.
- ✅ Block direct URL access unless authorized.
- ✅ Never rely on client-side checks (like hiding buttons) for security!
